# langchain_demo to Generate MCQ 

Our project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the process of Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) generation. By employing state-of-the-art language models, we have developed a system that can understand and analyze textual content to create relevant and contextually accurate multiple-choice questions.

The project utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to extract key information from input texts, ensuring the generated MCQs are both challenging and aligned with the content. 

With a user-friendly interface, our system allows educators, content creators, and subject matter experts to input text, such as educational materials, articles, or textbooks. The LLM then processes the text, identifies crucial concepts, and formulates meaningful MCQs. This not only saves time for content creators but also ensures a consistent and standardized approach to question generation.

1. First create a virtual environment
```bash
conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y
```
2. Activate the environment
```bash 
source activate ./venv
```
if you use anaconda terminal 
```
conda activate venv/
```
3. Install the requirements.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
